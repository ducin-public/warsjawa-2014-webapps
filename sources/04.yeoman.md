# [yo](http://yeoman.io/): project scaffolding

![Yeoman project scaffolding logo](../images/yeoman-small.png "yeoman logo")

[yeoman search](http://yeoman.io/generators/)

install yeoman tool:

    [sudo] npm install -g yo

search `generator-*` node modules (`npm search generator-`)

## using generators

install specific generator:

    [sudo] npm install -g generator-webapp

and run it:

    mkdir my-yo-project
    cd my-yo-project
    yo webapp

if running `grunt` fails on PhantomJS, your test depencencies may not be satisfied. Need to run:

    cd test
    bower install
    cd ..

## yeoman workflow

:exclamation: everything is configured for you. Really.

build the entire application:

    grunt build

open your application (source version):

    grunt serve

and built version:

    grunt serve:dist

analyse the new Gruntfile. As long as you can ;)

## backbone generator

install [generator-backbone](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-backbone):

    [sudo] npm install -g generator-backbone

and follow [typical workflow](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-backbone#typical-workflow) instructions.
