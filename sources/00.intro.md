> JavaScript has been under phenomenal development during recent years. As an indirect result of browser wars, node.js has been introduced, which enabled developers to run JS on the server side. Thanks to this, lots of professional tools have been created: npm (package manager), grunt (automating, building), bower (assets manager), yeoman (skeleton generators). Additionally, many other tools could be executed on the server-side from now on, e.g. end-to-end testing without a browser (phantom/casper). This has promoted JS applications to full-professional projects with stable development workflow: building, testing, deployment - where everything is automated using well-known tools such as jenkins or git.

> Nowadays, the possibilities of JavaScript are a lot more than colourful forms written with obtrusive mixture of jquery and html, as it used to be some time ago. During this talk, I want to show what JavaScript can do now - what are the tools, how you can use them and why are they useful. And it doesn't matter what single-page-app framework you use (angular, bb, ember) or what server-side technology you use (the server itself doesn't have to rely on node.js).

 - _only if we have time: travis-ci, modernizr_

### aim
 - how to turn [raw development code](https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/blob/master/underscore.js) into [production app](http://google.com) *fast*
